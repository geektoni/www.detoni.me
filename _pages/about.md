## About

Currently, I am working in the **[Structured Machine Learning Group](http://sml.disi.unitn.it/)** as a machine learning researcher
under the supervision of [Prof. Andrea Passerini](http://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/) at
the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it), Italy.

My research interests concentrate on developing new Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning methods to perform efficient **program synthesis** and **program generation**. I am also
interested in **interpretable machine learning** techniques.

During my studies, I interned at **[CERN](http://cern.ch)** (2019) and I spent a semester at the **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)** (2018) as an Erasmus student. I also participated in the **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)** (2017) as a Software Developer for [Shogun](https://shogun.ml), a machine learning library.

I received my Bachelor and Master's degree (cum laude) from the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it) in 2017 and 2020 respectively. I also obtained a **scholarship** for my academic performance through my undergraduate studies.
