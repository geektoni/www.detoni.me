## About

I am former Research Assistant in the **[Structured Machine Learning Group](http://sml.disi.unitn.it/)** under the supervision of [Prof. Andrea Passerini](http://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/) at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it), Italy.

My main interests are deep learning, reinforcement learning, program synthesis
and interpretable machine learning methods.

During my studies, I interned at **[CERN](http://cern.ch)** (2019) and I spent a semester at the **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)** (2018) as an Erasmus student. I also participated in the **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)** (2017) as a Software Developer for [Shogun](https://shogun.ml), a machine learning library.

I received my Bachelor and Master's degree (cum laude) from the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it) in 2017 and 2020 respectively. I also obtained a **scholarship** for my academic performance through my undergraduate studies.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, chess. I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to automatize human activity with intelligent agents. If you want to have a gist of what I am currently working on, please visit my Github page at [github.com/geektoni](https://github.com/geektoni).

### Trivia

I should technically have an [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) of 5. It doesn't mean much, but it is funny mathematical folklore to not tell you about it.
