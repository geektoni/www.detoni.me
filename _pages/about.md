## About

I am a Research Intern in the [Structured Machine Learning Group](http://sml.disi.unitn.it/)
under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Passerini at
the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it), Italy. I am also currently pursuing a Master in Computer Science at the same university and I will graduate in March 2020.

During my studies, I interned at [CERN](http://cern.ch) (2019) and I spent a visiting period at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (2018). I also participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (2017) as a Software Developer for [Shogun](https://shogun.ml), a machine learning library.
I received a scholarship from the University of Trento for my academic performance through the Bachelor degree.

My current research interests are about applying deep learning and reinforcement learning for
neural program synthesis and program generation.
